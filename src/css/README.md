Note:

When working with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), itâ€™s good practice to ensure that class names are unique across your entire project. This helps prevent unintended side effects or conflicts when styles are applied to elements. If you reuse the same class name in different files or components, it can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if those files are loaded together on the same page. By maintaining unique class names, you can avoid such issues and make your styles more predictable and maintainable.
